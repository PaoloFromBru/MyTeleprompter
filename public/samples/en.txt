Ladies and Gentlemen,
it is a great pleasure to address you today about the work carried out by APPLiA.

APPLiA is the association representing the home appliance industry in Europe.
Our sector directly employs more than 200,000 people,
and indirectly supports millions of jobs across the value chain.

Our mission is simple yet ambitious:
to promote innovation, sustainability, and competitiveness.

We work every day with European institutions,
with national governments, and with civil society organizations.
Our goal is to bring the voice of an essential sector,
one that touches the everyday life of hundreds of millions of European citizens.

Today, I would like to focus on a specific segment:
cooling appliances.

The global demand for these products is rapidly increasing.
There are many reasons for this:
the growth of the world’s population,
the rising living standards in many emerging regions,
and of course, climate change,
which brings longer and hotter summers.

Looking at Europe,
we see similar trends, but also some unique characteristics.
On the one hand, European consumers ask for ever more efficient appliances,
capable of reducing energy consumption and household bills.
On the other hand, European legislators set strict standards,
to ensure both safety and environmental sustainability.

It is therefore necessary to consider the legislative framework.
The F-gas regulation, for example,
imposes significant restrictions on the use of fluorinated gases,
which are essential to the functioning of many cooling systems.

Another sensitive topic concerns PFAS,
the so-called “forever chemicals”.
The idea of a full ban raises important questions,
as many industrial applications still lack viable alternatives.

Yet, there are also positive perspectives.
The RePower EU plan, for instance,
accelerates the energy transition,
creating opportunities for more efficient appliances
and for innovative technologies to reduce overall emissions.

In such a complex environment,
what is the way forward for an association like APPLiA?

Our answer is clear:
a constant dialogue with institutions,
a collaborative approach with all stakeholders,
and a firm commitment to ensure that sustainability goes hand in hand with competitiveness.

Defending European manufacturing does not mean asking for protectionism.
It means creating a level playing field,
where European companies can continue to invest in innovation and employment.

Our sector has shown its ability to adapt,
to invest in digitalisation and in energy efficiency,
and it will continue to do so.

APPLiA will remain by the side of institutions and citizens,
to build together a greener, safer, and more prosperous future for Europe.

Thank you for your attention.
